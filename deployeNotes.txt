These are the deploye notes

1. we are deploying front end on Netlify and backend on Heroku.

Backend:

d-1: npm add dotenv
d2: import and config that in server.js
d3: dont use manual port, create a port constant variable

Note: all this was happening in server.js

d4: Create Procfile(needed for Heroku)
    write web: node server.js
    which is the serving file. this tells heroku which 
    command have to run afetr deployment.

d5: in package.json inside scripts, add
    start : node server.js

now on heroku you can deploye branch 
so we need to create the bakend_deploye branch having backend files only

Note: in that branch package.json should be in the root

so d7:
    a. created a branch using checkout
    b. remove all the files from tracking
    c. add one by one from main branch.
    d. now this branch only containg package-lock, package.json, Procfile, server.js
    e. were ready to deploye it and deployed it. (getting some errors due to grammerly extension)
       run in other browser.
    f. get the link of this and set it as the end point for frontend.

now backend has deployed and we have the heroku app link.

d8: get the link of this and set it as the end point for frontend.
d9: build the app "npm run build" inside the react app
d10: drag and drop build folder into Netlify.
